        <p> The advent of foundation models (FMs) in healthcare offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance medical diagnostics through automated classification and segmentation tasks. However, these models also raise significant concerns about their fairness, especially when applied to diverse and underrepresented populations in healthcare applications. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks, standardized pipelines, and easily adaptable libraries to evaluate and understand the fairness performance of FMs in medical imaging, leading to considerable challenges in formulating and implementing solutions that ensure equitable outcomes across diverse patient populations. To fill this gap, we introduce \ours, a fairness benchmark for FM research in medical imaging. \ours{} integrates with 17 popular medical imaging datasets, encompassing different modalities, dimensionalities, and sensitive attributes. It explores 20 widely used FMs, with various usages such as zero-shot learning, linear probing, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and prompting in various downstream tasks -- classification and segmentation. Our exhaustive analysis evaluates the fairness performance over different evaluation metrics from multiple perspectives, revealing the existence of bias, varied utility-fairness trade-offs on different FMs, consistent disparities on the same datasets regardless FMs, and limited effectiveness of existing unfairness mitigation methods.

              <ul>
                <li>Bias is prevalent in using FMs for medical imaging tasks, and the fairness-utility trade-off in these tasks is influenced not only by the choice of FMs but also by how they are used;</li>
                <li>There is significant dataset-aware disparities between SA groups in most FMs;</li>
                <li>Consistent disparities in SA occur across various FMs on the same dataset; and</li>

          The figure above presents the pipeline of FairMedFM framework, which offers an easy-to-use codebase for benchmarking the fairness of FMs in medical imaging. FairMedFM currently contains 17 datasets (9 for classification and 8 for segmentation) and 20 FMs (11 for classification and 9 for segmentation).
          It also integrates 9 fairness metrics (5 for classification and 4 for segmentation) and 6 unfairness mitigation algorithms (3 for classification and 3 for segmentation), trying to provide a relatively comprehensive benchmark for fairness in medical imaging FMs.

          Our generation exploitation attack explores various generation strategies, primarily centered around the system prompt and decoding strategies. Regarding the system prompt, we consider either 1) prepending it before the user instruction, or 2) <b> not including it</b>. In terms of decoding strategies, we experiment with the <b>temperature sampling, top-p sampling and top-k sampling with different hyper-parameters</b>.

        <p> In addition to existing benchmarks, we also introduce the <a href="https://github.com/Princeton-SysML/Jailbreak_LLM/blob/main/data/MaliciousInstruct.txt">MaliciousInstruct dataset</a>, which contains 100 malicious instructions of 10 different malicious intents for evaluation. We evaluate on 11 models: <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/">Vicuna</a> (7B, 13B, and 33B), <a href="https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b">MPT</a> (7B and 30B), <a href="https://falconllm.tii.ae/">Falcon</a> (7B and 40B), and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">LLaMA2</a> (7B, 13B, 7B-chat, and 13B-chat). Note that among all the models, only LLaMA2-7B-chat and LLaMA2-13B-chat have been explicitly noted to have undergone safety alignment. For these two models, we sample 8 times for each decoding variant to further enhance the attack performance.

        <p>As shown, we are able to boost the attack success rate for 11 models to >95% with our generation exploitation attack. <span style="color: red;">Alarmingly, for models that have undergone safety alignment (marked with "♠"), <b>a simple exploitation of generation variants increases the risk from 0% to 95%!     </b></span>  Human evaluation further shows that among the misaligned output, more than 50% of them provide harmful instructions.</p>
        
        <p>Moreover, our generation exploitation attack consistently strikes higher success rates than the SOTA attack by <a href="https://llm-attacks.org/">Zou et al. </a>,
          while its compute time is an order-of-magnitude less (around 30x).</p>

        <p> Here are 10 examples for our attack on the LLaMA2-7B-chat model, each for a distinct malicious intent. <label for="select-data">You can select the type of malicious intent from the dropdown list:</label>
